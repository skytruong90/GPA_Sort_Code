# Title: GPA Sorting
### I worked on this by myself and the programming language I used is C Programming. 

## How to install:
1. Clone the repository:  https://github.com/skytruong90/GPA_Sorting.git
2. The main code is inside the code folder when you download everything.
3. Run the project with any IDE.

## My Objective: 
### To create a GPA sorting code that would let end user add students, display student records, and sort their name as well as their GPA.

## What did I learned:
1. Familiarity with the C programming language: Developing a program in C may have provided you with a deeper understanding of the language syntax and data structures.
2. Problem-solving skills: Programming requires careful planning, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities to identify potential issues and debug your code.
3. Importance of error handling: Programming languages can be unforgiving if errors go unhandled. As a result, you might have learned how to effectively handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.
4. Importance of testing: Testing your code is crucial to identify errors and confirm that the program meets the desired outcomes. You might have learned the importance of developing a robust testing process to ensure program functionality.

## What I would improved:
1. Code optimization: You could have optimized the code to reduce memory usage and improve performance. This could have included reducing the number of loops or using more efficient algorithms.
2. User interface design: A well-designed user interface can improve the user experience and make the program more intuitive to use. You could have improved the interface design to make it more user-friendly and visually appealing.
3. Error handling: You could have implemented better error handling to provide more informative error messages and to handle errors more gracefully. This could have improved the overall reliability of the program.
4. Code organization: Organizing the code into modular components can make it easier to read, understand, and maintain. You could have improved the organization of the code to make it more modular and easier to maintain.

## Key features:
1. User Input: The program should allow the user to input a list of GPAs that they want to sort.
2. GPA Sorting: The program should sort the list of GPAs in ascending or descending order.
3. Display Sorted GPAs: The program should display the sorted GPAs to the user in a clear and readable format.
4. GPA Validation: The program should validate that each inputted GPA is within a valid range (e.g. between 0 and 4).
5. Error Handling: The program should handle any errors or exceptions that may occur during the GPA sorting process, such as invalid inputs or insufficient memory.
6. File Input/Output: The program could allow the user to read GPAs from a file or write sorted GPAs to a file.
