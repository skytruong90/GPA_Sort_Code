## What did I learned:
1. Familiarity with the C programming language: Developing a program in C may have provided you with a deeper understanding of the language syntax and data structures.
2. Problem-solving skills: Programming requires careful planning, critical thinking, and problem-solving abilities to identify potential issues and debug your code.
3. Importance of error handling: Programming languages can be unforgiving if errors go unhandled. As a result, you might have learned how to effectively handle errors and provide meaningful feedback to users.
4. Importance of testing: Testing your code is crucial to identify errors and confirm that the program meets the desired outcomes. You might have learned the importance of developing a robust testing process to ensure program functionality.
